* Ultra-large-scale systems pain points
- slow builds
- uncontrolled dependencies
- each programmer using a different subset of the language
- poor program understanding (code hard to read, poorly documented, and so on)
- duplication of effort
- cost of updates
- version skew
- difficulty of writing automatic tools
- cross-language builds

_Reference:_ Rob Pike's 2012 talk [[https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article][Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering]].

* Experiment
Go Started as an experiment by Google engineers

: it is said that it was during slow 45min builds that Go was conceived.
