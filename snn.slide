* Goal

In this presetation we will elaborate upon some of the most important computational and mathematical features of networks of spiking neurons.

* Part I - On the computational power of circuits of spiking neurons

- Basic concepts

- Recurrent circuits with fading memory define filters with fading memory

- Real-time computing with analog input

- Real-time computing on spike trains

* Basic Concepts

- Time invariant filters:

In other words: in order to characterize a time invariant filter we just need to observe its output values at time 0, while it input varies over all functions. Hence one can replace
in the mathematical analysis such filter by a functional (a simpler mathematical object that maps input functions on real values rather than on functions of time).

* Basic Concepts

- The fading memory property:

Informally, a filter F has fading memory if the most significant bits of its current output value (Fu)(0) depend just on the most significant bit of bits of its input function u(.) in some finite time interval [-T, 0] going back into the past.
